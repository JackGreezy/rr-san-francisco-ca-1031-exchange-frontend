# 1031 Exchange San Francisco

## Taxonomy Rationale

This site uses a structured taxonomy designed to support nationwide replacement property identification for 1031 exchange investors in San Francisco, CA. The taxonomy prioritizes property identification services over intermediary or compliance support, reflecting the site's focus on helping investors find suitable replacement properties across the United States.

Services are organized into seven categories: Timelines (45 day and 180 day deadline management), Structures (three property, 200 percent, reverse, and improvement exchange strategies), Execution (qualified intermediary coordination, escrow, lender support), Tax (like kind qualification, boot analysis, transfer tax coordination), Reporting (Form 8824 preparation), Property Paths (nationwide identification, NNN search, multifamily, industrial, retail, medical office), and Education (1031 exchange resources).

Locations include San Francisco and 22 nearby cities and neighborhoods within 30 to 45 miles, plus a nationwide option for remote property identification. Property types focus on NNN retail assets including convenience stores, drive thru QSR, pharmacies, dollar stores, and other single tenant net lease properties that qualify for like kind treatment.

The layout diversity system ensures each service and location page uses a different layout variant, preventing visual repetition and improving user engagement. Layouts are assigned using round robin distribution to ensure balanced variety across all pages.
