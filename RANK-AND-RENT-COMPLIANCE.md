# Rank and Rent Compliance Guidelines

## Core Rules

### Never Claim Past Projects or Specific Clients

Do not reference specific past projects, client names, or completed transactions. Frame all scenarios as examples of the type of engagement we can handle.

### Example Framing

Use language like:
- "Example of the type of engagement we can handle"
- "We can share references upon request"
- "Contact us to discuss your situation"

Never use language like:
- "We completed a 1031 exchange for..."
- "Our client in..."
- "We successfully..."
